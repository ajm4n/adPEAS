usage: python3 adPEAS.py 

IF AUTOINSTALL DOES NOT WORK:

installation:
1. python3 -m venv adPEAS
2. source adPEAS/bin/activate
3. pip3 install impacket
4. pip3 install certipy-ad
5. pip3 install bloodhound


adPEAS v1.0 - supports Certipy, BloodHound, findDelegation, and Kerberoasting.  Will add more features as I get to work on them, lol.
